# Codebase Recovery Requirements

## Introduction

The MinQ Flutter application codebase has been severely damaged by automated script rewrites, resulting in over 2000 compilation errors. The primary issues include broken design token system (MinqTokens), corrupted AI service integrations, malformed UI components, and syntax errors throughout the codebase. This recovery effort aims to restore the application to a compilable and runnable state while preserving the implemented features described in the master task plan.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN MinqTokens class SHALL provide all required design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadows)
2. WHEN UI components reference `tokens` THEN they SHALL successfully access the tokens through proper import or context extension
3. WHEN components use MinqTheme THEN it SHALL be properly defined with complete theme data and accessible throughout the app
4. WHEN the token system is used THEN it SHALL support both light and dark themes with proper color schemes
5. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN tokens SHALL provide appropriate high-contrast alternatives
6. WHEN spacing is referenced THEN all spacing scale values (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl) SHALL be available
7. WHEN typography is used THEN all text styles (h1-h4, body, caption, button) SHALL be properly defined
8. WHEN border radius is applied THEN all radius values (sm, md, lg, xl, full) SHALL work correctly
9. WHEN shadows are applied THEN shadowSoft and shadowStrong SHALL render properly
10. WHEN color references are made THEN all semantic colors (primary, secondary, success, error, etc.) SHALL be available

### Requirement 2: AI Service Integration Complete Recovery

3. WHEN habit recommendations are requested THEN recommendHabits SHALL provide relevant, ranked suggestions
4. WHEN failure prediction is triggered THEN predictFailure SHALL calculate accurate risk scores with reasons and recommendations
5. WHEN sentiment analysis is performed THEN analyzeSentiment SHALL return valid positive/neutral/negative scores
6. WHEN habit suggestions are generated THEN generateHabitSuggestion SHALL provide personalized advice
7. WHEN AI integration manager is used THEN it SHALL coordinate all AI services properly
8. WHEN AI controllers are accessed THEN they SHALL integrate with TFLite services without type mismatches
9. WHEN AI-powered screens load THEN they SHALL display AI-generated content correctly
10. WHEN AI services fail THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL provide graceful degradation

### Requirement 3: UI Component Structure Complete Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all UI components to have proper structure and syntax so that the application compiles and runs without any errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Flutter analyze is run THEN there SHALL be zero compilation errors across all files
2. WHEN malformed `_build` fields are encountered THEN they SHALL be converted to proper method implementations
3. WHEN undefined methods are referenced THEN they SHALL be implemented or removed appropriately
4. WHEN UI components are rendered THEN they SHALL display correctly without crashes or missing widgets
5. WHEN user interactions occur THEN event handlers SHALL function properly with correct signatures
6. WHEN navigation happens THEN routing SHALL work without undefined route errors
7. WHEN state management is used THEN providers and controllers SHALL operate correctly with proper types
8. WHEN widgets reference missing classes THEN those classes SHALL be implemented or imports fixed
9. WHEN syntax errors exist THEN they SHALL be corrected to valid Dart code
10. WHEN deprecated APIs are used THEN they SHALL be updated to current Flutter/Dart standards

### Requirement 4: Critical Screen Complete Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application screens to load and function properly so that I can access every feature without crashes or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home screen loads THEN it SHALL display all gamification elements, AI features, and navigation without errors
2. WHEN settings screens are accessed THEN they SHALL render all options correctly with proper token styling
3. WHEN quest-related screens are used THEN they SHALL handle quest operations, timers, and completion flows properly
4. WHEN AI-powered screens are accessed THEN they SHALL integrate with TFLite services and display AI content successfully
5. WHEN navigation occurs between screens THEN transitions SHALL work smoothly with proper routing
6. WHEN smart notification settings are opened THEN all tabs and analytics SHALL display without undefined errors
7. WHEN stats screens are accessed THEN charts and metrics SHALL render with proper theme integration
8. WHEN subscription screens are used THEN premium features and payment flows SHALL work correctly
9. WHEN onboarding screens are accessed THEN progressive features and level systems SHALL function properly
10. WHEN specialized screens (mood tracking, time capsule, etc.) are used THEN they SHALL operate without compilation errors

### Requirement 5: Complete Feature Integration Preservation

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want all implemented features from the master task plan to remain fully functional after recovery so that no development progress is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gamification features are used THEN points, badges, challenges, and reward systems SHALL work correctly with proper UI integration
2. WHEN AI features are accessed THEN all 7 TensorFlow Lite AI services SHALL function properly (chat, recommendations, predictions, etc.)
3. WHEN social features are used THEN pair matching, referral systems, and community features SHALL operate correctly
4. WHEN premium features are accessed THEN subscription management, streak recovery, and monetization SHALL work properly
5. WHEN progressive onboarding is used THEN level systems and feature unlocking SHALL function correctly
6. WHEN advanced AI features are used THEN real-time coaching, social proof, and habit stories SHALL work properly
7. WHEN mood tracking is accessed THEN sentiment analysis and correlation features SHALL function correctly
8. WHEN time capsule features are used THEN AI prediction and delivery systems SHALL work properly
9. WHEN event systems are accessed THEN seasonal events and challenges SHALL operate correctly
10. WHEN all 49 master task features are tested THEN they SHALL maintain their implemented functionality

### Requirement 6: Build and Runtime Complete Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build and run successfully with zero errors so that testing, development, and deployment can continue without issues.
